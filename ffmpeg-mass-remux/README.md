# ffmpeg-mass-remux
This script will convert all video files in a folder to another file format, using ffmpeg.

**Usage**

Replace the file extension in line 2 to the file extension of the files you want to convert, and then change the extension on line 5 to the desired file format.
Make sure that the videos title does not contain any full stops as the title will be cut off past it.
